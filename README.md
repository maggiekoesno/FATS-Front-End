React Native application for Facial-recognition-based Attendance Taking System (FATS)

This is the Front-End codebase for the FATS prototype.

## Set Up

### Mobile Prerequisites

Install the `Expo Client` app on your mobile device (preferably a tablet) to run the app. Alternatively, you can run an emulator on your machine.

### Machine Prerequisites

```
node 14.8 or above
npm 6.14.7 or above
```

Make sure you have the `node.js` and `npm` installed. You can verify your version by running:

```
node --version
npm --version
```

### Installation

#### Download and `cd` into this repository

```
cd FATS-Front-End
```

#### Install npm packages

```
npm install
```

#### Start the application

```
expo start
```

#### Run the emulator

Run the emulator on your machine or scan the barcode with your mobile device to run it using the `Expo Client` app.

## Back-End Integration

Set the environment variable `ENPOINT` to the address and port where the backend is running if you are running it locally. Otherwise, set `ENDPOINT` to point to your server.
