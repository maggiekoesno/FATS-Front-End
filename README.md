# Facial-recognition-based Attendance Taking System (FATS)
> A mobile application built for NTU's CZ3002 Advanced Software Engineering.

This application aims to improve the performance, experience, and integrity of the current manual attendance taking system 
in most universities or institutions. It is optimized for tablets and makes use of facial recognition technology to allow 
easy and efficient attendance taking at the beginning of each class. Other features provided by FATS include easy access 
to past attendance records and secure overridng abilities for teachers or class coordinators. FATS is built to be highly 
scalable and extensible such that it can be implemented in different schools and sectors all over the world.

This source code is the front-end portion of the application.
