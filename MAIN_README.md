# Facial-recognition-based Attendance Taking System (FATS)

> A mobile application built for NTU's CZ3002 Advanced Software Engineering.

This application aims to improve the performance, experience, and integrity of the current manual attendance taking system
in most universities or institutions. It is optimized for tablets and makes use of facial recognition technology to allow
easy and efficient attendance taking at the beginning of each class. Other features provided by FATS include easy access
to past attendance records and secure overridng abilities for teachers or class coordinators. FATS is built to be highly
scalable and extensible such that it can be implemented in different schools and sectors all over the world.

This is the sourcecode for the FATS prototype.
